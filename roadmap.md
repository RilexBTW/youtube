## YTDL GUI Roadmap

### - Add Support for all YouTubeDL / FFMPEG functions while remaining simplistic and easy to user
### - Create an update utility as an optional function to assist non tech savvy users
### - Create an executable file for Windows Users so dependencies aren't needed to use / install
### - Create a Download History list
### - Show output of terminal in application window instead of using a terminal
